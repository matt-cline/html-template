	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		3 - Electrical installations are the most sensitive parts of construction that can pose the greatest risk to the safety of persons in the event of flooding. However, this risk can be avoided by making a general cut to the TGBT prior to the rising of the water and carrying out a general inspection before reintegration. It is therefore easy to reduce the impact of this damage on personal safety.

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		3- The rehabilitation of the electrical installations which conditions the reintegration of premises is a rather heavy operation when: - the water reaches the distribution and protection tables, - power supplies, in particular, power sockets and switches are made from the ground and not downwards. In this case, the facility's vulnerability to damage to these facilities is high
	</p>

	<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

	<p>
		The electrical distribution network and related equipment are particularly vulnerable. They are nevertheless essential for efficient drying (heating, ventilation) and cleaning, thus reducing the time required to return to the home. Water conveyed by flooding is often chemically aggressive, especially if it is salty. This can lead to corrosion, which can severely damage the electrical equipment and cause malfunctions. Flooding can pollute electrical installations by carrying sludge or even mechanically damaging equipment and possibly cables. The complete replacement of electrical equipment which has undergone a long-term flooding is therefore the general rule, such as a hazard that has caused damage requiring replacement of the internal partitions. This reflection can make the building unavailable for a few weeks. limit the damage to the electrical circuits by modifying their path in the housing.

	<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

	<p>
	Individualize the circuits between flooded parts and parts out of water: It is virtually impossible to permanently prevent water from entering the building. To anticipate the consequences of this penetration on the circuits between flooded parts and parts out of water. This solution makes it possible to isolate parts of the internal network vulnerable during flooding, safe power supply in non-flooded rooms. The return home is thus favoured. The rehabilitation of the network in the flooded part can thus be carried out without consequences on the network of the non-flooded parts. This measure is to be implemented in combination with other measures concerning electrical installations and must be entrusted to a professional. From a technical point of view, there are two types of electrical architecture that allow the individual parts of the flood and the parts out of water to be identified. <br/> 1. Using circuits protected by the flood zone in the General Repair Chart. These circuits will be marked and cut before the flooding. With this typology, the separation of the circuits is done by function and by zone. <br/> 2. By installing a divisional panel specific to the flood zone and external electrical installations. In this second case, the location is simplified. It will be enough to cut the protective devices that feeds the divisional table on the repair board. <br/> - Use electrical circuits (strong currents and communication or communication circuits) to avoid retention of water in ducts and ducts. The power grid is a passage for water during the flood. It contains areas where water and moisture can stagnate (especially in ducts) after flooding, which poses a danger to users and may cause repeated breakdowns. In addition, difficulty accessing ducts and junction boxes is a problem to ensure drying. By lowering the grids from the ceiling and the upper parts of the dwelling to the ground, the risk of stagnation of the house is greatly reduced, since after the start of the water, the "self-draining" of the ducts by gravity is favoured as well as the drying of the network. In the case of low flooding (up to 30 cm) with a short duration (less than 48 hours), it is also possible to avoid damaging the partitions by opening them to restore the networks: water evacuation taking place by simply dismantling outlets. The networks concerned are also strong currents (lighting, motive power, possible electric heating ...) as weak currents (telephone, alarms, videophone). To the extent that the level of water rise is not excessively high, it is recommended to take advantage of the rehabilitation works to move sockets and switches at a height where they will be less likely to be submerged in the event of a flood. Electrical appliances will therefore be located, if possible, above the level of the highest known waters, while respecting accessibility for people with reduced mobility, i.e. a maximum of 1m30. A check of the switchgear (sockets, interrupts), accompanied by a complete drying must however be carried out before re-energizing. This measure is to be implemented in combination with other measures concerning electrical installations and must be entrusted to a professional. <br/> - Absolute respect of the rules for the design and implementation of electrical installations inside the building.
