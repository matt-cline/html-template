	<h2>Solid wood stairs</h2>

	<h3>Addition criterion</h3>

	<p>
		Water height > 1m and a duration of immersion > 3 days.
	</p>

	<h3>Potential damages</h3>

	<p>
		Wooden staircase: as with other wooden elements, the damage is related to the duration of the immersion (probability of damage of 80% beyond 3 days). The damage corresponds to deformations of the silts and the steps.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		0 - No impact on personal safety.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		1 - The staircase can condition the access to the area out of water. However, it can be used temporarily despite its deformation (insofar as the stability of the staircase is ensured) and its replacement can be rapid. The effect on return to normal remains low.
