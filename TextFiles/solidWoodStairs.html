		<h3>Additional criterion</h3>

		<p>
			Water height > 1m and a duration of immersion > 3 days. (Zone 3)
		</p>

		<h3>Potential damages</h3>

		<p>
			As with other wooden elements, the damages are related to the duration of the immersion (probability of damage of 80% beyond 3 days). The damage corresponds to deformations of the silts and the steps.

		<p>
			1 - The staircase can condition the access to the area out of the water zone. However, it can be used temporarily despite its deformation (as far as the stability of the staircase is ensured) and its replacement can be rapid. The effect on return to normal remains low.
