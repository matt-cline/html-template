			Filling and deposition of mud.

		<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

		<p>
			Crawlspaces prevent the contact of the lower floor with the ground and thus limit the risks of rising dampness. To ensure ventilation, openings are provided in the masonry. However leading to be filled with water during a flood, various objects driven by the current can enter the space of the crawlspace. Since the crawlspace is very often limited to a few decimetres in height, it can be difficult to extract these objects after the backflow of water. The measure aims at preventing the penetration of objects while promoting the evacuation of water during reflux and the ventilation of the sanitary space.
		</p>

		<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

		<p>
			The measure consists of checking the presence or possibly creating at least two openings on the walls of the crawl space. The opening must respect the following guidelines: <br/>- Avoid placing an opening facing the current in such a way as to avoid a massive entry of water, in particular in the event of runoff.<br/>
		</p>

		<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

		<p>
			The measure consists of checking the presence or possibly creating at least two openings on the walls of the crawl space. The opening must respect the following guidelines:<br/> - Avoiding placing them on the same wall, to favour the ventilation of the crawl space.<br/>- Must have effective ventilation, a minimum height of 0.8m, with easy access and circulation.
