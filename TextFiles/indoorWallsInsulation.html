		<h2>Insulation present in indoor walls</h2>

		<h3>Additional criterion</h3>

		<p>
			Water height > 0.5m (zone3).
		</p>

		<h3>Potential damages</h3>

		<p>
			Impregnation of the insulation of the lining, if it is hydrophilic.
		</p>

		<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

		<p>
			The construction rules know how to limit the permanent contact of materials, such as insulating materials, with liquid water, which degrades their performance. The stresses undergone by an insulating material in the event of a flood are not currently considered by the protocols for qualification of the performance of these materials. The measure concerns the choice of thermal and acoustic insulation to limit their degradation during flooding. The general recommendation is the replacement of insulation that has undergone flooding.

		<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

		<p>
			No suggestion for resisting strategy.
		</p>

		<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

		<p>
			In the absence of qualified products withstanding high immersion times without loss of thermal and acoustic performance, the insulation propreties may be become deteriorated after immersion. The insulation lies in structures exposed to external climatic agents such as floors, walls and roof. The measures cannot be applied to insulators which cannot be replaced or are very difficult to replace: <br/> - Insulation located under the hard surface pavement solid or under the top floor of the crawl space. <br/> - Insulation inside the walls; <br/> The replacement of the insulation behind the partition walls requires the dismantling of these partitions, which may not be deteriorated by the flood. Thermal insulation on the inside of the walls can be replaced with important work on the dubbing. The thermal insulation present on the outside of the walls in external thermal insulation systems can be replaced without the need for access to the interior of the housing. In the case of low water levels, it is advisable to favour insulation from the outside.

		<p>
			3 - When rehabilitation leads to the replacement of all bulkheads and duplicates, this is a cumbersome operation that compromises the reinstatement of the premises for many months. In this case, the vulnerability of the building to the return to normal is strong.
