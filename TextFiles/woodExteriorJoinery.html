		<h3>Potential damages</h3>

		<p>
			External wooden doors: deformation, buckling, detachment of panels.

		<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

		<p>
			If some cases of distortion or rupture due to the water force have been reported on exterior joinery and shutters, it is above all the immersion which can cause damage. The choice of the constituent material is therefore essential. For example, after contact with water, wood joinery undergoes deformation, swelling, peeling, and appearance of mould during drying. In fact, very often, they no longer perform their functions and it is necessary to replace them. Another phenomenon is that the breakage of the glazing, such as French windows, can occur under the sole effect of water pressure. The aim of the measurement is to choose materials that are not very sensitive to water such as metal or PVC.

		<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

		<p>
			Installation grids in front of the doors to voiding intrusion as well as allowing some water to pass through.
		</p>

		<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

		<p>
			Use of water-insensitive materials for exterior doors, patio doors, windows and shutters. With these materials, a careful cleaning followed by drying and possible replacement of the joints (foam, rubber) makes it possible to find satisfactory operation. The prescription of materials that are not sensitive to water concerns the entire joinery (opening and window frames). Installation grids in front of the doors to allow water to pass through as well as avoiding intrusion. In some areas where water is rising rapidly, it is recommended to allow water to enter the dwelling to balance the interior-exterior pressures and thus avoid damage to the structure of the building. For this purpose, an anti-intrusion grid, the masonry attachment system of which would be installed beforehand, could be installed temporarily in front of the doors and windows left open. This measure also allows for more effective drying after flooding (longer opening time by limiting the risks of intrusion and theft).

		<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

		<p>
			0 - No impact on the safety of persons, except for the breakage of glazing. The latter can be avoided by allowing the water to penetrate inside to balance the pressures.

		<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

		<p>
			1 - Restoration work only conditions the reintegration of premises. Adjustment and replacement work can be done from the outside.
