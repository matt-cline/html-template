		<h2>Electric Water Heater</h2>

		<h3>Additional criterion</h3>

		<p>
			Water height > 1.5m (zone 3)
		</p>

		<h3>Potential damages</h3>

		<p>
			- deterioration of the control and control box, <br/> - deterioration of the water heater itself.
		</p>

		<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

		<p>
			The use equipment of climatic engineering is in nowaday housing is frequent and their operation is generally very sensitive to the water. These include boilers, heat pumps, regulating devices, etc. This equipment is often expensive and can be seriously damaged by immersion. They facilitate the return to normal, such as the drying of the walls. It is therefore preferable to raise them above the level of the reference flood or the highest known waters. As with electrical installations, a short-term immersion requires the replacement of all electrical and electronic equipment that has been in contact with water. It is therefore important to avoid as far as possible that these elements are immersed.

		<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

		<p>
			2 - Like any electrical equipment, the water heater can be hazardous to people as protective devices, differential circuit breakers, are themselves damaged. Vulnerability can therefore be high.

			2 - If the water heater is to be replaced, the vulnerability is at an average level.
