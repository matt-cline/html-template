	<h2>Doors and doors of wooden cupboards or alveolar panel interior fittings</h2>

	<h3>Addition criterion</h3>

	<p>
		Water height > 0.5m
	</p>

	<h3>Potential damages</h3>

	<p>
		Iso-planes"" honeycomb doors: swelling, deformation. <br/> - Solid doors, panel doors: deformation.<br/> - Wooden frames and wooden baseboards: deformation<br/>
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		0 - No impact on personal safety.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		1 - Low impact on return to normal.

	<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

	<p>
		Interior joinery (opening / leaf and frame / door frames) are not designed for prolonged immersion. This exposure to water can cause damage. However, depending on the constituent material, they behave more or less well in the face of this immersion. For example, after contact with water, wooden interior joinery can undergo drying, deformation, swelling (particle board, cardboard), detachment (plywood panels), and appearance of mould. In fact, very often, they no longer perform their functions and it is necessary to replace them. The choice of the constituent material is therefore essential.

	<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

		Preferring frames that are not sensitive to waterIt is recommended to use materials that are not sensitive to water such as aluminium and treated steel. With these materials, careful cleaning followed by drying and possible replacement of the joints (foam, rubber) make it possible to find satisfactory operation. As a result, the choice of metal frames makes it possible to replace only the internal doors damaged by the flood. This easy change may be necessary from a half-day immersion for "insulating" honeycomb doors or chipboard closet doors. Preferring baseboards not sensitive to water Plinths made of PVC or ceramics are not very sensitive to water. This option allows to limit the consequences of the flooding, provided that the fixing of the skirting boards guarantees their maintenance during and after their immersion.
