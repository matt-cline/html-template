	<h2>Presence of existing wastewater piping</h2>

	<h3>Addition criterion</h3>

	<p>

	</p>

	<h3>Potential damages</h3>

	<p>
		Rupture or disconnection of evacuation pipes (sewage) placed on the ground or on breeze blocks.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		1 - A slight vulnerability exists for health reasons since the building's wastewater spilled in the crawl space, or the external waters laden with toxic chemicals, have stagnated in this crawl space for one or several weeks.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		1 - The return to normal is conditioned by the fact that the water contained therein, in particular wastewater or toxic waste water, can be discharged Ventilate effectively and disinfect it.
	</p>

	<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

	<p>
		The crawl space prevents the contact of the low floor with the ground and thus limits the risks of rising dampness. To ensure ventilation, openings are provided in the masonry. However leading to be filled with water during a flood, various objects driven by the current can enter the space of the crawlspace. Since the crawlspace is very often limited to a few decimetres in height, it can be difficult to extract these objects after the backflow of water. The measure aims at preventing the penetration of objects while promoting the evacuation of water during reflux and the ventilation of the sanitary space.

	</p>

	<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

	<p>
		The measure consists of checking the presence or possibly creating at least two openings on the walls of the crawl space. The opening must respect the following guidelines: <br/> - Avoiding placing them on the same wall, to favour the ventilation of the crawl space.<br/> - Avoid placing an opening facing the current in such a way as to avoid a massive entry of water, in particular in the event of runoff.<br/> - Must have effective ventilation, a minimum height of 0.8m, with easy access and circulation.
