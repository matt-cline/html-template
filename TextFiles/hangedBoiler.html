	<h2>Wall-mounted gas boiler</h2>

	<h3>Addition criterion</h3>

	<p>
		Water height > 1.5m
	</p>

	<h3>Potential damages</h3>

	<p>
		Boiler and accessories (burner, pump, electrical control panel, etc.): degradation
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		2 - Water damage to the electrical parts of pumps, burners, control and regulating panels and convectors may affect the safety of persons insofar as protective devices, differential circuit breakers Even damaged. Vulnerability can be high.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		2 - The operation of the heating system ensures in some cases the production of domestic hot water and especially conditions the drying time. However, in the latter case, the heating of the premises may be provided by temporary means. The impact on the reintegration of premises therefore remains at an average level.

	<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

	<p>
		The equipment of climatic engineering essential to the use of the housing are numerous and their operation is generally very sensitive to the water. These include boilers, heat pumps, regulating devices, etc. This equipment is often expensive and can be seriously damaged by immersion. They facilitate the return to normal, such as the drying of the walls. It is therefore preferable to increase them definitively above the level of the reference flood or the highest known waters. As with electrical installations, a short-term immersion requires the replacement of all electrical and electronic equipment that has been in contact with water. It is therefore important to avoid as far as possible that these elements are immersed.
