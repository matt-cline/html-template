		<h2>Presence of glued laminated textile or parquet flooring</h2>

		<h3>Additional criterion</h3>

		<p>
			Water height > 0.5m (zone 3)
		</p>

		<h3>Potential damages</h3>

		<p>
			Plastic coating: detachment. <br/> Textile coating: separation and indelible stains. <br/> Parquet on joists and glued parquet: swelling, deformation and detachment.
		</p>

		<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

		<p>
			The floor coverings have a decorative function and are very much solicited by the movements of people and objects. There is a very wide variety of mineral products (tiles, stones), organic (wood), synthetic (paint, plastic or textile coatings). Their method of application or fixing to the floor depends on their nature: sealing, gluing, nailing, on a framework, direct application in a thin layer of a paint. The flooring may have a specific degradation mode when it is in contact with the flood water: peeling, swelling ... This type of degradation is generally the main cause of damage, but the support (floorboard, paving) may itself be affected by flooding leading to collapse, deformation or cracking. The measure concerns the choice of the floor covering that would be little affected by the water (at the level of the material itself or its method of fixing) and must take into consideration: <br/> - The behaviour of the material against prolonged contact with water. <br/> - Its cost <br/> - Its ease of replacement as it helps to reduce damages and the return to normal.

		<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

		<p>
			No suggestion on resisting strategy.

		<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

		<p>
			The support may be a slab or a floorboard. Floor coverings fall into several categories in terms of their behaviour during flooding:<br/> - Coatings that are relatively inexpensive but must always be replaced after flooding: carpets and floating floors of entry level for example.<br/> - Coatings requiring a higher initial investment but more likely to behave better during a flood event or otherwise, quite easy to clean: tiling for example.<br/> - Coating with a method of attachment of which is sensitive to water, although the material itself is slightly degraded: soft floors, glued floors.<br/> - Coating with a method of attachment of which may be moderately sensitive but whose material may be affected, for example traditional parquet. <br/> It is recommanded to choose baseboards not sensitive to water. Plinths made of PVC or ceramics are not very sensitive to water. This option allows to limit the consequences of the flooding, provided that the fixing of the skirting boards guarantees their maintenance during and after their immersion.

		<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

		<p>
			1 - Low vulnerability: risk of falling on deformed parquet or loose tiling.

		<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

		<p>
			3 - The repair times are variable depending on the floor covering.<br/> - Low vulnerability for bonded tiles<br/> - Medium vulnerability for plastic, textile or glued flooring<br/> - Strong vulnerability to parquet flooring on joists.
