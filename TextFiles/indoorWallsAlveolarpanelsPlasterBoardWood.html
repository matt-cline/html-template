		<h2>Presence of alveolar panels, plasterboard or wood for indoor walls</h2>

		<h3>Additional criterion</h3>

		<p>
			Water height > 0.5m (zone 3).
		</p>

		<h3>Potential damages</h3>

		<p>
			Deformation, swelling, degradation of lightweight partitions and lining consisting of alveolar panels (cardboard base), chipboard panels, gypsum plasterboard.
		</p>

		<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

		<p>
			A prolonged contact with water leads to degradation of the qualities of the distribution walls, mostly if made of plaster-based elements.The direct consequences can range from a simple detachment of the wall coverings to the collapse of the partitions. Indirect consequences may relate to electrical or heating installations and equipment integrated into the partition or integral with the partition, as well as the sanitary conditions for the occupancy of the dwelling (retention of organic elements by the materials constituting the partitions). The objective of the measure is essentially to facilitate post-flood restoration work.

		<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

		<p>
			No suggestion for resisting strategy.

		<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

		<p>
			Avoid alveolar partitions and partitions made of wood-based materials. In addition to their function of delegating and organizing the interior space of the dwelling, the partition walls also ensure the passage or fixing of the equipment. If they get damaged during the flood, they need to be rehabilitated or replaced. <br/> Cases of rehabilitation after flooding:<br/> In the event of destruction of the partitions, the total restoration of the partition is required whatever the type. It is recommended to rebuild partitions on metal framing. In the case of immersion alone, the nature of the repair depends on the type of partition of origin: <br/> - Partition of the type "honeycomb partitions": Total refurbishment is inevitable. It is recommended to rebuild partitions on metal framing. <br/> - Partitions of the type "partition on frame" without mineral wool inside the partition: conservation of the plasterboard not reached by the water and the capillary ascents is conceivable. The degraded parts of the plates needs to be removed and replaced by new elements which are screwed onto the framework which needs to be carefully dried beforehand. <br/> - Partitions of the type: "partition on framework with mineral wool inside the partition: it is recommended to replace the mineral wool and dismantle the plates replacing the deteriorated ones, and reuse the framework which needs to be thoroughly dried beforehand. <br/> - Masonry partitions coated with plaster: the parts of the plaster not reached by the water and the capillary ascents can be preserved. The immersed part needs to be washed abundantly and dried. It would need to be replaced if the hardness has been significantly affected during the flood. <br/> - Walls made of plaster tile: the wall may be retained if the hardness of the plaster, measured after an abundant wash and a final drying, has not been significantly affected during the flood. Otherwise, the entire partition must be rebuilt. Waterproof plaster tiles or metal frame partitions may be used. <br/> - Wood particle board partitions: immersed parts degrade after a few hours due to swelling. Total refurbishment is recommended.

			3 - When rehabilitation leads to the replacement of all bulkheads and duplicates, this is a cumbersome operation that compromises the reinstatement of the premises for many months. In this case, the vulnerability of the building to the return to normal is strong.
