		<h2>Air conditioner</h2>

		<h3>Additional criterion</h3>

		<p>
			Water Height > 1.5m (Zone 3)
		</p>

		<h3>Potential damages</h3>

		<p>
			Deterioration of electrical parts (motor) of mono-bloc or dual-unit air conditioners and fan coils associated with a centralized installation.

		<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

		<p>
			The use equipment of climatic engineering is in nowaday housing is frequent and their operation is generally very sensitive to the water. These include boilers, heat pumps, regulating devices, etc. This equipment is often expensive and can be seriously damaged by immersion. They facilitate the return to normal, such as the drying of the walls. It is therefore preferable to raise them above the level of the reference flood or the highest known waters. As with electrical installations, a short-term immersion requires the replacement of all electrical and electronic equipment that has been in contact with water. It is therefore important to avoid as far as possible that these elements are immersed.

		<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

		<p>
			No suggestion for resisting strategy.

		<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

		<p>
			Putting water-powered equipment out of the water zone: This measure consists of raising, moving or arranging a permanent barrier to displace the heat production equipment (boiler, heat exchanger, heat pump) and domestic hot water, air conditioning and ventilation (extractors Air, air intakes) as well as accessory equipment (pumps, control units, control panels). This can be achieved in several ways depending on the presence of an additional floor and, more generally, of the house design. Implementation of this measure can quickly come up against practical considerations concerning the actual possibility of raising and using the equipment under safety conditions require (electrical safety, access to equipment, evacuation of products of combustion, air required for combustion, etc.).

		<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

		<p>
			2 - The electrical parts of these devices may present a hazard like any electrical equipment. However, the impact of the damage on the safety of people is related to the accessibility of the equipment (position on the floor or ceiling).

		<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

		<p>
			1 - On one hand, it is possible to withstand for some time the absence of air conditioning. On the other hand, replacing the hardware is a simple operation. Vulnerability to damage on these facilities is low.
