	<h2>Wooden FloorBoards</h2>

	<h3>Addition criterion</h3>

	<p>

	</p>

	<h3>Potential damages</h3>

	<p>
		Swelling and deformation of wood panels.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		2 - The wood floor must be part of the checklist as part of the general inspection before reinstatement. It influences the vulnerability linked to the safety of people (deformation, even possible breakage of the panels).
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		3 - Work to restore or replace wooden floors is rather heavy work and, in addition, conditions work on other parts of the building such as partitions and flooring. Consequently, damage to wooden floors is an element of high vulnerability to return to normal.
	</p>

	<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

	<p>
		The techniques used to construct low floors of existing buildings are very varied, but for single-family houses, joist floor structures (metal, reinforced concrete) and slabs (terracotta, concrete, synthetic material) and slabs Place are the most common. Except for intense mechanical action like that caused by a ring, these structures are not very vulnerable to flooding. The drying takes several months but the mechanical characteristics are a priori little affected. The measure is aimed at replacing low floors that are more vulnerable to water (such as a wooden structure) by a reinforced concrete floor. This operation evaluates the possibility of raising the level of the initial floor to locate the new floor above the level of the highest known waters.

	<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

	<p>

	</p>

	<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

	<p>
		The replacement of an existing floor deemed vulnerable by a reinforced concrete floor is an operation that can be envisaged during a major transformation of the building (upgrading, horizontal extension for example). It must pass through a structural engineering study that considers the other elements of the structure.
