	<h3>Potential damages</h3>

	<p>
		Can be carried away by water. It becomes a dangerous floating object and its content spreads causing pollution of hydrocarbons. They can also attack a pipeline, even people. A plastic tank may deform if the pressure of the water develops. Water can also enter the tank through the vents.

	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		To analyse specifically.

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		To analyse specifically.
	</p>

	<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

	<p>
		Avoid the archimedes thrust on the tanks or secure it to a structure resistant to this thrust.
	</p>

	<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

	<p>
		1 - Place or move the tank in a non-submersible place. <br/> 2 - Or reinforce the support and anchorage of the tank.

		1 - Place or move the tank in a non-submersible place. <br/> 2 - Or reinforce the support and anchorage of the tank.
