	<h2>Insulation present in indoor walls</h2>

	<h3>Addition criterion</h3>

	<p>
		Water height > 0.5m
	</p>

	<h3>Potential damages</h3>

	<p>
		Impregnation of the insulation of the lining, if it is hydrophilic.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		0 - No impact on personal safety.
	</p>

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		3 - When rehabilitation leads to the replacement of all bulkheads and duplicates, this is a cumbersome operation that compromises the reinstatement of the premises for many months. In this case, the vulnerability of the building to the return to normal is strong.
	</p>

	<h3>Objectives of prevention works</h3>

	<p>
		The construction rules know how to limit the permanent contact of materials, such as insulating materials, with liquid water, which degrades their performance. The stresses undergone by an insulating material in the event of a flood are not currently considered by the protocols for qualification of the performance of these materials. The measure concerns the choice of thermal and acoustic insulation to limit their degradation during flooding. The general recommendation is the replacement of insulation that has undergone flooding.

	<h3>Works for the resiting strategy </h3>

	<p>

	</p>

	<h3>Works for the yielding strategy </h3>

	<p>
		In the absence of currently qualified products to withstand high immersion times without loss of thermal and acoustic performance, use insulation that may be poorly deteriorated after immersion. The insulation lies in structures exposed to external climatic agents: <br/> Floor, walls, roofing. The measure cannot be applied to insulators which cannot be replaced or are very difficult to replace: <br/> - Insulation located under the hard surface pavement solid or under the top floor of the crawl space. <br/> - Insulation inside the walls; The replacement of the insulation behind the partition walls requires the dismantling of these partitions, which may not be deteriorated by the flood. Thermal insulation on the inside of the walls can be replaced at important work on the dubbing. The thermal insulation present on the outside of the walls in external thermal insulation systems can be replaced without the need for access to the interior of the housing. In the case of low water levels, it is advisable to favour insulation from the outside.
