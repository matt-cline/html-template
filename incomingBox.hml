	<h3>Vulnerability from the security of people point of view</h3>

	<p>
		3 - Electrical installations are the most sensitive parts of construction that can pose the greatest risk to the safety of persons in the event of flooding. However, this risk can be avoided by making a general cut to the TGBT prior to the rising of the water and carrying out a general inspection before reintegration. It is therefore easy to reduce the impact of this damage on personal safety.

	<h3>Vulnerability from return to normal point of view</h3>

	<p>
		3- The rehabilitation of the electrical installations which conditions the reintegration of premises is a rather heavy operation when: - the water reaches the distribution and protection tables, - power supplies, in particular, power sockets and switches are made from the ground and not downwards. In this case, the facility's vulnerability to damage to these facilities is high.
